Revision history for Terminal-Print

{{$NEXT}}
  NOTE: Special thanks to patrickbkr++ who implemented ALL of the following!

  [Bug Fixes]
  - Automatically convert Rat/Real positions to Int in print commands

  [Functionality]
  - Add Grid.set-span-sgr method, allowing colors/attributes to be specified
    with raw ANSI SGR strings rather than named identifiers

  [Packaging]
  - Switch from depending on Term::termios to Terminal::API for portability

  [Performance/Portability]
  - Stop shelling out to `tput` anywhere:
    * For escape sequences now that ANSI/VT sequences "won"
    * For terminal size now that Terminal::API is available


0.976  2023-08-20T15:07:58-07:00
  [Packaging]
  - Require exactly Term::termios:ver<0.2> to avoid bugs later in 0.2.x series.


0.975  2023-06-24T21:59:25-07:00
  [Features]
  - Add support for Grid.with-grid-lock method, which allows widget libraries
    built on top of Terminal::Print to observe the T::P::Grid locking protocol:
    during low-level copies and other grid changes, the destination Grid holds
    a mutex for thread safety.


0.974  2023-06-10T20:45:32-07:00
  [Features]
  - Support override of box corner style in BoxDrawing role

  [Packaging]
  - Update CI checkout action to v3 to avoid GitHub warnings
  - Drop CI testing on old Rakudos (conflict with current `prove6`)


0.973  2022-07-22T15:36:47-07:00
  - Begin conversion to modern packaging
