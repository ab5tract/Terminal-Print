    =title Terminal::Print

    =head1 Synopsis

    L<Terminal::Print> implements an abstraction layer for printing characters to
    terminal screens with full Unicode support and -- crucially -- the ability to
    print from concurrent threads. The idea is to provide all the necessary
    mechanical details while leaving the actual so called 'TUI' abstractions to
    higher level libraries.

    Obvious applications include snake clones, rogue engines and golfed art works :)

    Oh, and Serious Monitoring Apps, of course.

    =head1 Usage

    L<Terminal::Print> creates you an object for you when you import it, stored in
    C<$Terminal::Print::T>. It also creates a constant C<T> for you in the C<OUR::>
    scope.

    Thus common usage would look like this:

    =for code
    T.initialize-screen;
    T.print-string(20, 20, DateTime.now);
    T.shutdown-screen;

    =head1 Miscellany

    =head2 Where are we at now?

    All the features you can observe while running C<perl6 t/basics.t> work using
    the new react/supply based L<Terminal::Print::Grid>. If you run that test file,
    you will notice that C<Terminal::Print> is needing a better test harness.
    Part of that is getting a C<STDERR> or some such pipe going, and printing state/
    That will make debugging a lot easier.

    Testing a thing that is primarily designed to print to a screen seems a bit
    difficult anyway. I almost think we should make it interactive. 'Did you see a
    screen of hearts?'

    So: async (as mentioned above), testing, and debugging are current pain points.
    Contributions welcome.

    =head2 Why not just use L<NativeCall> and C<ncurses>?

    I tried that first and it wasn't any fun. C<ncurses> unicode support is
    admirable considering the age and complexity of the library, but it
    still feels bolted on.

    C<ncurses> is not re-entrant, either, which would nix one of the main benefits
    we might be able to get from using Perl 6 -- easy async abstractions.

    =begin Golfing

    The golfing mechanism is minimal. Further golfing functionality may be added via third party modules,
    but the following features seemed to fulfill a 'necessary minimum' set of golfing requirements:

        - Not being subjected to a constructor command, certainly not against the full name of the class
            + Solved via an optional argument to the use/import statement, eg C<use Terminal::Print <T>>
                will create an instance and stash it in the importing scope as C<T>.
            + By default we do not construct an object for you.
        - Having a succinct subroutine form which can initialize and shutdown the screen automatically
            + Solved via 'draw'
        - Easy access to .print-string, sleep, colorization, and the grid indices list. (Even easier than using T());
            + Solved via 'd', 'w', 'h', 'p', 'cl', 'ch', 'slp', 'fgc', 'bgc', 'in'
